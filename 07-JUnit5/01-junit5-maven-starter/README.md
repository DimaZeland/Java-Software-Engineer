# JUnit 5 Maven Starter

ℹ️ The project implements unit, integration and acceptance tests.

### ⚙️ The project uses:

- Java SE 15 (for distributing a portable code for desktops and servers)
- Apache Maven (project build system)
- Lombok library (to reduce the code in the classes)
- JUnit 5 framework (to perform unit, integration and acceptance tests) 
- Mockito framework (for testing applications using fictitious objects instead of real program objects)
- AssertJ library (to enrich the Assertions functionality)
- Hamcrest library (for conveniently composing test checks using the assertThat predicate)
