## JUnit 5 Starter

ℹ️ The project implements all types of tests (unit, integration, acceptance) using the Mockito and JUnit 5 frameworks. To enrich the Assertions functionality, the project additionally uses the AssertJ and Hamcrest libraries. To reduce the code in the classes and extend the functionality of the Java language, the project also uses the Lombok library.
