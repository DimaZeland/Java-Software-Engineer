# Spring Boot 3

‚ÑπÔ∏è The project implements the creation of dynamic cloud Java applications and microservices using Spring Boot 3.

### ‚öôÔ∏è The project uses:

- Java SE 17 LTS (for distributing a portable code for desktops and servers)
- The Apache Groovy programming language
- Kotlin Programming Language
- The Scala Programming Language
- Apache Maven (project build system)
- Spring Boot (for automatic Spring project configuration)
- Lombok library (to reduce the code in the classes)
- MySQL (relational database)
- H2 database (in order to conduct full testing)
- MongoDB (document-oriented NoSQL databases)
- Spring Data JPA (for writing custom queries)
- MyBatis (SQL mapping framework that abstracts JDBC boilerplate code)
- JOOQ (Java persistence framework that provides a Fluent API to write typesafe SQL queries)
- GraphQL (a query language that provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API)
- Thymeleaf library (modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments)
- Apache Tomcat (web server and servlet container)
- Flyway (to maintain databases and synchronize their structure with related software)
- Docker container (to deploy databases)
- Heroku (a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that enables developers to build and run applications in the cloud)
- Apache Commons (provides features to make Java Collections Framework handling easy)
- Spring WebFlux (to support building reactive web applications)
- R2DBC (a specification to integrate SQL databases using reactive drivers)
- Spring Security (a framework for securing Java-based applications at various layers)
- SLF4J logging library (adapter for working with Log4J logging environment)
- Log4j (Apache Logging Service for logging application behavior)
- testcontainers library (to improve the execution of integration tests)
- JUnit 5 framework (to perform unit, integration and acceptance tests)
- Twitter4J (Java library for the Twitter API)
- Spring Native (compile applications to native images, drastically reducing the application's startup time)
