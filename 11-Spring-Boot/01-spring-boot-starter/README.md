# Spring Boot Starter

ℹ️ The project uses Spring Boot and provides practical examples of integrating with various tools, libraries, frameworks, relational and non-relational databases, writing REST APIs, validating requests and any other objects, writing integration tests.

### ⚙️ The project uses:

- Java SE 17 LTS (for distributing a portable code for desktops and servers)
- Gradle (project build system)
- Groovy Gradle DSL (a gradle specific way to form build scripts)
- Lombok library (to reduce the code in the classes)
- PostgreSQL database
- Querydsl library (to build dynamic queries)
- Spring Data JPA (for writing custom queries)
- Docker container (to deploy databases)
- Flyway (to maintain databases and synchronize their structure with related software)
- testcontainers library (to improve the execution of integration tests)
- SLF4J logging library (adapter for working with Log4J logging environment)
- JUnit 5 framework (to perform unit, integration and acceptance tests) 
- Hamcrest library (for conveniently composing test checks using the assertThat predicate)
